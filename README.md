- 🌱 I’m currently learning: distributed systems, Rust, and advanced TypeScript.
- 👯 I’m open to: collaboration on open-source projects, mentorship, and full-time engineering roles.
- 💬 Ask me about: web performance, UI/UX, and building developer-friendly APIs.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy optimizing developer workflows and automating repetitive tasks.
